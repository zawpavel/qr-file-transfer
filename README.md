# QR file transfer  
Transfer files between your computer and smartphone with ease!  
You can send files from your computer to your smartphone and vice versa, as long as the devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi  
All you need to do is just scan the QR code  
It does not matter what operating system you have:  
```
OS X -> Android smartphone  
iOS smartphone -> Windows  
Linux -> iOS smartphone  
```
all transfers are the same - through http  

This program is built on the basis of the project [qrcp](https://github.com/claudiodangelis/qrcp) using GUI toolkit [fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne)  
### How the utility looks like

### Installation
The best way is to build the application yourself   
```
go install github.com/zawpavel/qr-file-transfer@latest
```
Or you can try downloading the binaries on the [release page](https://github.com/zawpavel/qr-file-transfer/releases), but no guarantee that it will work on your machine 	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
